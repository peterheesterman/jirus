## Jirus

A benign javascript virus.

I have always thought of viruses being written in assembly language but when I read the book - "The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses" this changed. 

After realising they can extremely easily be written in javascript i decided to write this simple one for fun.

The same caveats apply to this code as applies to the code in the book:
 - Unless you know what you are doing probably avoid running this code.
 - If you choose to build upon this code, be responsible and careful.
